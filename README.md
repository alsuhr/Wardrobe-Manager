## When Running the Program
This program currently runs on the command line. 
Initially, you will need to add all your articles of clothing in your wardrobe but it will be saved to a CSV file for future recall. Currently, there is no way to remove clothing from the program interface, instead you must manually edit the CSV file.
When running the program, it will prompt you for values related to the weather, colthing availability, and activities of the day.
